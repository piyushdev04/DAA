Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Algorithm for Bubble Sort
Input:

Array arr[] of size n.

Steps:

- Iterate over all elements:
 - For each pass, compare each adjacent pair of elements and swap them if the current element is greater than the next.
 - Continue doing this for nâˆ’1 passes or until no swaps occur.

Output:

Sorted array.
